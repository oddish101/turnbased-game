first lets talk about what the project is
its a turn based game with with a party of 4 charcter 
warrior/has 1.fell cleave which boost his basic attack by 5% 2.shake it off which restores his hp 3.Rage which doubles his basic attack damege and makes his fell cleaver and shake it off useless
healer which has 1.cure restore 150 hp to a party member 2.heal which restores 50 hp to every party member
archer/ which have poison shot which makes the enemy take passive damege and motivate which incresses every party member basic damege by 30%
and lasty is sowrdsmen which has 1.backstap which does a higher amount of damege at the cost of 50hp and 2.regen which restores 100hp
everybody has a passive healing 


the project uses basic paython code and it can't handle errors
